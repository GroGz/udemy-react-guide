# List & Conditional

## Dynamic expressions. Javascript expressions

We can call javascript functions inside attributes on JSX structures, but we can call javascript that returns JSX structures too.

> { [\<Card />, \<Card />]

This array can be translated in two JSX components, and we can call a javascript function that returns an array of JSX.
